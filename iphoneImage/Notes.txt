2. An NSURLSessionConfiguration object defines the behavior and policies to use when making a request with an NSURLSession object. We can set things like the caching policy on this object. The default system values are good for now, so we'll just grab the default configuration.
3. Create an NSURLSession object using our session configuration. Any changes we want to make to our configuration object must be done before this.
